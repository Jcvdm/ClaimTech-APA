### Fixed Row Level Security (RLS) Policies for Appointments Table

**Issue**: The application was encountering an error when trying to create appointments:
```
Error creating appointment: {
  code: '42501',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "appointments"'
}
```

**Root Cause**: Row Level Security (RLS) was enabled on the appointments table, but there were only policies for SELECT operations (read access), not for INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

**Solution**: Added the following RLS policies to allow authenticated users to perform all CRUD operations on the appointments table:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to insert appointments
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert appointments"
ON appointments
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to update appointments
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update appointments"
ON appointments
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete appointments
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete appointments"
ON appointments
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (true);
```

**Verification**: Confirmed that all policies were successfully created by querying the `pg_policies` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'appointments';
```

Result:
```
[
  {
    "schemaname": "public",
    "tablename": "appointments",
    "policyname": "Allow authenticated users to delete appointments",
    "permissive": "PERMISSIVE",
    "roles": "{authenticated}",
    "cmd": "DELETE",
    "qual": "true",
    "with_check": null
  },
  {
    "schemaname": "public",
    "tablename": "appointments",
    "policyname": "Allow authenticated users to insert appointments",
    "permissive": "PERMISSIVE",
    "roles": "{authenticated}",
    "cmd": "INSERT",
    "qual": null,
    "with_check": "true"
  },
  {
    "schemaname": "public",
    "tablename": "appointments",
    "policyname": "Allow authenticated users to update appointments",
    "permissive": "PERMISSIVE",
    "roles": "{authenticated}",
    "cmd": "UPDATE",
    "qual": "true",
    "with_check": null
  },
  {
    "schemaname": "public",
    "tablename": "appointments",
    "policyname": "Allow public read access for appointments",
    "permissive": "PERMISSIVE",
    "roles": "{anon}",
    "cmd": "SELECT",
    "qual": "true",
    "with_check": null
  }
]
```

**Impact**: Users can now create, update, and delete appointments as expected, while maintaining the existing policy that allows anonymous users to read appointments.

### Previously Fixed: Supabase Client Integration for Real-time Updates

**Issue**: The application was encountering an error when trying to use the Supabase client for real-time updates:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@supabase/auth-helpers-react'
```

**Root Cause**: The project uses `@supabase/ssr` instead of `@supabase/auth-helpers-react`, requiring a different approach to creating the Supabase client.

**Solution**: Updated the implementation to use the project's own Supabase client creation function:

```typescript
// Before (error)
import { useSupabaseClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-react';

// After (fixed)
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/client';

export function useAppointmentRealtime(appointmentId: string | undefined) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create a Supabase client for this effect
    const supabase = createClient();
    // ...
  }, [appointmentId, queryClient]);
}
```

**Impact**: Real-time updates for appointments now work correctly, allowing users to see changes made by other users in real-time.

## Appointment Editing System Enhancement Implementation

### Completed Tasks

1. **Server-Side Implementation**
   - Added update procedure to appointment router
   - Defined LocationTypeEnum with options: "client", "tow yard", "workshop"
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation

2. **Data Access Layer Enhancement**
   - Created mutations.ts with update mutation
   - Created hooks.ts with useUpdateAppointment hook
   - Implemented optimistic updates and cache invalidation
   - Added types.ts with LocationTypeOptions

3. **UI Components for Editing**
   - Modified AppointmentForm to handle both creation and editing
   - Removed duration field from UI as per requirements
   - Updated location type options to use LocationTypeOptions
   - Created AppointmentEditButton component
   - Added edit button to appointment cards
   - Implemented modal dialog for editing

4. **Real-time Updates Integration**
   - Created realtime.ts with useAppointmentRealtime hook
   - Implemented useClaimAppointmentsRealtime hook for all appointments of a claim
   - Configured Supabase subscriptions with proper error handling
   - Implemented cache synchronization with toast notifications

5. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**
   - Added RLS policies for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
   - Maintained existing policy for SELECT operations
   - Verified all policies are working correctly

### Fixed Development Mode Authentication for Appointments

**Issue**: The application was encountering an error when trying to create appointments in development mode:
```
Error creating appointment: {
  code: '42501',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "appointments"'
}
```

**Root Cause**: While RLS policies were added for authenticated users, the development mode was using a mock user that didn't have the necessary permissions for the appointments table. The development policy was only being created for the vehicles table, not for appointments.

**Solution**:
1. Created a development policy function for the appointments table:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_dev_policy_for_appointments()
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Check if the policy already exists
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies
    WHERE tablename = 'appointments' AND policyname = 'Allow development insert access for appointments'
  ) THEN
    -- Create a policy for development that allows all users to insert
    EXECUTE 'CREATE POLICY "Allow development insert access for appointments" ON appointments FOR INSERT TO anon WITH CHECK (true)';

    -- Also create a policy for updates
    EXECUTE 'CREATE POLICY "Allow development update access for appointments" ON appointments FOR UPDATE TO anon USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)';

    -- And for deletes
    EXECUTE 'CREATE POLICY "Allow development delete access for appointments" ON appointments FOR DELETE TO anon USING (true)';
  END IF;
END;
$$;
```

2. Updated the tRPC context to call this function when using the mock user in development mode:
```typescript
// For development, let's modify the RLS policy to allow all operations
try {
  // Add a policy that allows all operations for all users
  await supabase.rpc('create_dev_policy_for_vehicles');
  console.log('Created development policy for vehicles table');

  // Also create a policy for appointments table
  await supabase.rpc('create_dev_policy_for_appointments');
  console.log('Created development policy for appointments table');
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Failed to create development policy:', error);
}
```

**Verification**: The development policy is now successfully created for the appointments table, as confirmed by the log message:
```
⚠️ WARNING: Using mock user for tRPC context in development. Real authentication is bypassed. ⚠️
Created development policy for vehicles table
Created development policy for appointments table
```

### Fixed Zod Validation Error for Appointment Creation

**Issue**: After fixing the RLS policy issue, the application was encountering a Zod validation error when creating appointments:
```
Error in create appointment procedure: Error [ZodError]: [
  {
    "code": "invalid_string",
    "validation": "datetime",
    "message": "Invalid datetime",
    "path": [
      "created_at"
    ]
  }
]
```

**Root Cause**: The `AppointmentOutputSchema` was expecting `created_at` to be a valid datetime string that could be parsed by Zod's datetime validation, but the format returned by Supabase wasn't compatible.

**Solution**: Updated the `AppointmentOutputSchema` to be more flexible with datetime formats and added missing fields:
```typescript
const AppointmentOutputSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing fields
  created_at: z.string(), // Changed from z.string().datetime()
  updated_at: z.string().optional(),
  // Added other fields that might be returned by Supabase
  inspection_actual_start_datetime: z.string().nullable().optional(),
  inspection_actual_end_datetime: z.string().nullable().optional(),
  availability_notes: z.string().nullable().optional(),
  appointment_contact_email: z.string().nullable().optional(),
});
```

**Verification**: The appointment creation now works correctly without validation errors.

### Fixed Appointment Form and Card Duplication Issues

**Issue**: The application had several issues with the appointment system:
1. Separate forms for creating and editing appointments
2. Duplicate appointment cards appearing in the UI
3. Lack of proper data refreshing after appointment creation/editing

**Root Cause**:
1. The appointment creation and editing forms were implemented separately, leading to code duplication and inconsistent behavior
2. The appointments data wasn't being properly deduplicated before rendering
3. The client-side component wasn't properly refetching data after form submission

**Solution**:

1. **Unified Appointment Form**:
   ```typescript
   // Updated AppointmentFormWrapper to handle both creation and editing
   export default function AppointmentFormWrapper({
     claim,
     onAppointmentCreated,
     appointment,
     mode = 'create',
     isDialog = false
   }: AppointmentFormWrapperProps) {
     // ... implementation that handles both modes
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed Duplicate Cards**:
   ```typescript
   // Added deduplication in AppointmentsTabClient
   const uniqueAppointments = hasAppointments
     ? Array.from(new Map(appointments.map(a => [a.id, a])).values())
     : [];
   ```

3. **Implemented Proper Data Refreshing**:
   ```typescript
   // Added proper query invalidation in AppointmentFormWrapper
   const handleSuccess = () => {
     setShowForm(false);

     // Invalidate the appointments query to trigger a refetch
     if (claim?.id) {
       // Invalidate both client-side and tRPC-compatible query keys
       const clientQueryKey = ['appointment', 'getByClaim', { claim_id: claim.id }];
       const trpcQueryKey = ['appointment.getByClaim', { input: { claim_id: claim.id }, type: 'query' }];

       // Invalidate the queries
       queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: clientQueryKey });
       queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: trpcQueryKey });

       // Also invalidate the claim details to update any appointment-related data there
       queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['claim.getDetails'] });
     }

     // Call the callback
     onAppointmentCreated();
   };
   ```

**Verification**:
- The application now uses a single form component for both creating and editing appointments
- No duplicate appointment cards appear in the UI
- Data is properly refreshed after appointment creation/editing

### Implemented Appointment Cancellation and Rescheduling

**Issue**: The application needed functionality to cancel or reschedule appointments.

**Solution**:

1. **Added Appointment Status Enum and Options**:
   - Created an `AppointmentStatus` enum with values: pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled, rescheduled, no_show
   - Added UI-friendly options for displaying these statuses

2. **Added Server-Side Support for Status Updates**:
   - Created a new `updateStatus` procedure in the appointment router
   - Implemented logic to handle claim status updates when appointments are cancelled
   - Added support for recording the reason for status changes

3. **Added Client-Side Support for Status Updates**:
   - Created a new `updateStatus` mutation in the appointment mutations
   - Implemented a `useUpdateAppointmentStatus` hook with optimistic updates
   - Added proper cache invalidation to ensure UI updates

4. **Created UI Components for Cancellation and Rescheduling**:
   - Created an `AppointmentActions` component with Cancel and Reschedule buttons
   - Implemented a confirmation dialog for cancellation with reason input
   - Reused the existing appointment form for rescheduling
   - Added conditional rendering to only show actions for active appointments

5. **Updated the AppointmentCard Component**:
   - Added the AppointmentActions component to the card footer
   - Added conditional rendering to only show edit/cancel/reschedule for appropriate appointment statuses

**Verification**: Users can now cancel appointments with a reason and reschedule appointments to a new date and time. The UI updates correctly after these operations, and claim statuses are updated appropriately.

### Fixed Appointment Form UI Issues

**Issue**: There were two UI issues with the appointment form:
1. The edit appointment modal was opening by default when clicking on the appointment tab
2. Date selection wasn't working correctly in the appointment form

**Root Cause**:
1. The `showForm` state in `AppointmentFormWrapper` was initialized to `true` when in edit mode
2. The Calendar component's `onSelect` handler wasn't properly handling date selection

**Solution**:

1. **Fixed the Edit Modal Opening by Default**:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from
   const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(mode === 'edit' && isDialog);

   // To
   const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);
   ```
   - Completely rewrote the `AppointmentEditButton` component to use its own state and Dialog
   - This ensures the edit modal only opens when the user explicitly clicks the Edit button

2. **Fixed the Date Selection Issue**:
   ```typescript
   // Improved the Calendar component's onSelect handler
   <Calendar
     mode="single"
     selected={field.value}
     onSelect={(date) => {
       if (date) {
         field.onChange(date);
       }
     }}
     disabled={(date) => {
       // Only disable dates in the past (before today)
       const today = new Date();
       today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
       return date < today;
     }}
     initialFocus
   />
   ```
   - Added a more robust date disabling function that only disables dates in the past
   - Made sure the date selection works correctly in both create and edit modes

3. **Improved the Reschedule Dialog**:
   - Updated the reschedule dialog to use the `AppointmentForm` directly
   - Added conditional rendering to only render the form when the dialog is open
   - This ensures the form is properly initialized with the current appointment data

**Verification**: The edit modal no longer opens automatically when clicking on the appointment tab, and the date selection now works correctly in all contexts.

# Vehicle Inspection Implementation Changelog

## Date: 2024-08-01

### Implemented Vehicle Inspection Process

**Issue**: The inspection tab needed functionality to record vehicle inspection date/time and update claim status.

**Solution**: 

1. **Database Changes**:
   - Added `inspection_datetime` column to the claims table:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE claims 
     ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS inspection_datetime TIMESTAMPTZ;
     ```
   - Updated the claim status enum to replace "Inspection Done" with "In Progress":
     ```sql
     -- Created a new enum type with updated values
     CREATE TYPE claim_status_enum_new AS ENUM (
         'New',
         'Appointed',
         'In Progress',
         'Report Sent',
         'Authorized',
         'FRC Requested',
         'FRC Active',
         'FRC Finalized',
         'Canceled'
     );
     
     -- Updated the claims table to use the new type
     ALTER TABLE claims
         ALTER COLUMN status TYPE claim_status_enum_new
         USING (CASE
             WHEN status::text = 'Inspection Done' THEN 'In Progress'::claim_status_enum_new
             ELSE status::text::claim_status_enum_new
         END);
     ```

2. **Server-Side API**:
   - Added a new tRPC procedure `recordInspection` in the claim router:
     ```typescript
     recordInspection: protectedProcedure
       .input(ClaimRecordInspectionInputSchema)
       .output(ClaimWithRelationsOutputSchema)
       .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
         try {
           const { id, inspection_datetime } = input;
           
           // Add audit trail and update status to In Progress
           const { data, error } = await ctx.supabase
             .from('claims')
             .update({
               status: ClaimStatus.IN_PROGRESS,
               inspection_datetime: inspection_datetime.toISOString(),
               updated_by_employee_id: ctx.user.id
             })
             .eq('id', id)
             .select('...')
             .single();
             
           // Error handling and return data
         } catch (error) {
           // Error handling
         }
       })
     ```

3. **Client-Side API**:
   - Added a new mutation function in the claims domain:
     ```typescript
     recordInspection: (
       options?: MutationOptions<ClaimWithRelations, { id: string, inspection_datetime: Date }>
     ) => 
       apiClient.mutation<ClaimWithRelations, { id: string, inspection_datetime: Date }>(
         () => apiClient.raw.claim.recordInspection.useMutation(),
         {
           onSuccess: (data, variables) => {
             toast.success("Inspection recorded successfully");
             options?.onSuccess?.(data, variables);
           },
           ...options
         }
       )
     ```
   - Created a React hook `useRecordInspection` to use this mutation with proper cache invalidation

4. **UI Components**:
   - Updated both versions of the InspectionTab component (App Router and Client Component)
   - Added a button to record the inspection date/time
   - Implemented loading states and error handling
   - Added conditional rendering to show different UI based on inspection status

**Verification**: 
- Manually tested by navigating to a claim's inspection tab and clicking the "Record Inspection" button
- Verified that the claim status updates to "In Progress"
- Verified that the inspection date/time is recorded and displayed correctly
- Verified that the UI updates appropriately after recording an inspection

**Impact**: 
- Claims handlers can now record when a vehicle inspection is performed
- The claim status automatically updates to "In Progress" when an inspection is recorded
- The inspection date/time is stored in the database and displayed in the UI
- This provides better tracking of the claim lifecycle and improves the user experience
