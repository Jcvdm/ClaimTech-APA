## Known Issues

1. **Inspection Photo Upload RLS Policies** ✅ FIXED

   - Updated the `useSupabaseStorage` hook to use the Zustand auth store for authentication
   - Improved error handling and logging in the `useSupabaseStorage` hook
   - Enhanced the StorageImage component to better handle different URL formats and provide detailed logging
   - Fixed data integrity issue where photos exist in storage but inspection records were missing from database

   - ~~Server-side prefetching for claims is failing with 'No procedure found on path' errors~~
   - ~~tRPC server client configuration needs to be fixed for proper server-side rendering~~
   - Fixed by creating a proper request context for server-side tRPC calls
   - Implemented consistent approach across all server-side prefetching functions

   - ~~The job number generation system is not handling cases where claims were created with fallback "UNK" prefix~~
   - Fixed by implementing a global sequential numbering system using PostgreSQL sequence
   - Created a robust job number generation function that ensures uniqueness

2. **recordInspection Procedure Output Validation** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
   - The logs show an error with output validation for the recordInspection procedure
   - This is likely because the procedure is returning a status value that doesn't match the expected enum values
   - Need to update the output schema to match the actual data returned by the procedure

3. **Timeout Optimization** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
   - The current timeout values are quite long (5-8 seconds)
   - In a production environment, these should be adjusted based on server performance
   - Consider implementing a more sophisticated retry mechanism

4. **Caching Strategy Enhancement** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
   - While server-side prefetching works well, additional caching could improve performance
   - Consider implementing a more aggressive caching strategy for frequently accessed data
   - Explore using a service worker or other client-side caching mechanisms

5. **Error Tracking Improvement** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
   - The current error logging is good for debugging but lacks structured data for analytics
   - Consider implementing a more comprehensive error tracking system
   - This would help identify patterns in errors and prioritize fixes

6. **Cache Storage Limits**
   - localStorage has size limits (typically 5-10MB) which could be exceeded with large datasets
   - Need to monitor usage and implement cleanup mechanisms if needed

7. **Multi-Tab Coordination**
   - If a user has multiple tabs open with the same claim, changes in one tab might not be immediately reflected in others
   - Manual refresh is currently required to see changes made in other tabs

8. **Session Resumption**
   - If a user closes the browser and returns later, the session might be considered "active" but the cache could be stale
   - Need to add validation on session resumption

9. **UI/UX**
   - Mobile responsiveness needs improvement in some areas
   - Form validation feedback could be more user-friendly

10. **Technical Debt**
    - Some redundant code exists between client and server implementations
    - Test coverage is incomplete
    - Documentation needs updating in some areas
