Next Steps
Fix the recordInspection procedure: The logs show an error with output validation for the recordInspection procedure. This is likely because the procedure is returning a status value that doesn't match the expected enum values.
Optimize the timeouts: The current timeout values are quite long (5-8 seconds). In a production environment, you might want to adjust these values based on your server's performance.
Improve the error handling: While the current error handling is working, you might want to add more detailed error messages and better fallback mechanisms for different types of errors.
Add more comprehensive logging: The current logging is good for debugging, but you might want to add more structured logging for production use.
Consider adding more caching: The server-side prefetching is working well, but you might want to add more caching to improve performance, especially for frequently accessed data.
